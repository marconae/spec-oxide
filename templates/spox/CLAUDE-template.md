## Spec Oxide Instructions

Always read @.spox/workflow.md when the request:

- Mentions planning, proposals, or specs (words like proposal, spec, change, plan, design)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, or architecture shifts
- Involves performance, security, or cross-cutting concerns
- Sounds ambiguous and you need authoritative specs before coding

Use @.spox/workflow.md to learn:

- How to create, implement, and archive change proposals
- Spec format, delta operations, and scenario syntax
- Project structure and conventions

## Standards

Read @.spox/standards/ before implementation:

- @.spox/standards/backend.md — API, database, and query standards
- @.spox/standards/coding.md — General coding conventions
- @.spox/standards/frontend.md — UI components, CSS, responsive design
- @.spox/standards/global.md — Cross-cutting standards
- @.spox/standards/mcp.md — MCP tool preferences
- @.spox/standards/testing.md — TDD rules and verification
- @.spox/standards/vcs.md — Version control standards
