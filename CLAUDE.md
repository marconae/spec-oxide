## Spec Oxide Instructions

Always read `@.spox/workflow.md` when the request:

- Mentions planning, proposals, or specs (words like proposal, spec, change, plan, design)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, or architecture shifts
- Involves performance, security, or cross-cutting concerns
- Sounds ambiguous and you need authoritative specs before coding

Follow the workflow in `@.spox/workflow.md`:

- How to create, implement, and archive change proposals
- Spec format, delta operations, and scenario syntax
- Project structure and conventions

### Project Context

Read `@specs/mission.md` for project-specific conventions and goals.

### Standards Compliance

Read and **ensure** that Spec Oxide work aligns with the conventions, standards, laws, rules and workflows:

- `@.spox/standards/mcp.md` — MCP tool preferences
- `@.spox/standards/global.md` — Cross-cutting standards
- `@.spox/standards/coding.md` — General coding conventions
- `@.spox/standards/testing.md` — TDD rules and verification
- `@.spox/standards/backend.md` — API, database, and query standards
- `@.spox/standards/frontend.md` — UI components, CSS, responsive design
- `@.spox/standards/vcs.md` — Version control standards
